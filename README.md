# AI Interviewer (In Progress)

## Overview
AI Interviewer is an AI-powered platform designed to conduct automated, dynamic job interviews based on candidate responses. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and emotion detection, it provides an adaptive interview experience for candidates and recruiters.

## Features
- **Automated Interview Questions**: Dynamically generated questions based on candidate responses and job requirements.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken responses into text using OpenAI Whisper.
- **Emotion Detection**: Optional integration with IBM Watson to analyze emotional cues.
- **Cheating Prevention**: Potential use of computer vision to detect suspicious behavior.
- **Candidate & Employer Dashboards**: Separate interfaces for candidates and recruiters to manage interviews and applications.
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic interview scheduling and results communication via email.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Django with PostgreSQL
- **AI Models**: OpenAI GPT-4 (NLP), OpenAI Whisper (Speech-to-Text), IBM Watson (Emotion Detection)
- **Deployment**: Planned for cloud hosting

## Current Development Status
The project is still under development and is being built in five phases:
1. **Planning** (Completed)
2. **Design** (Completed)
3. **Development** (Ongoing)
4. **Testing** (Upcoming)
5. **Deployment** (Future Phase)
