# AI Interviewer (In Progress)

## Overview
AI Interviewer is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize the hiring process by automating job interviews. Using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and emotion detection technologies, the platform dynamically adapts interview questions based on candidate responses, providing a seamless and efficient experience for both candidates and recruiters.

## Key Features
- **Automated Question Generation**: The system intelligently formulates interview questions in real-time, tailoring them to the candidate’s responses and job requirements.
- **Speech Recognition & Analysis**: Utilizing OpenAI Whisper, the platform converts spoken answers into text for further processing and analysis.
- **Emotion Detection**: Integrates IBM Watson’s capabilities to assess the candidate’s emotions during the interview.
- **Fraud Prevention & Cheating Detection**: Future enhancements may include AI-powered vision analysis to detect dishonest behavior.
- **Candidate & Recruiter Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards for managing interview progress, reviewing responses, and assessing candidate performance.
- **Automated Email Notifications**: Candidates and recruiters receive timely email updates on interview scheduling, progress, and results.
- **Skill Assessment Integration**: Evaluates candidates based on predefined technical and behavioral competency benchmarks.
- **Data Security & Privacy**: Ensures compliance with industry standards for secure data handling and user privacy protection.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Angular (for an interactive and responsive user interface)
- **Backend**: Django with PostgreSQL (for robust and scalable backend operations)
- **AI Models**:
  - OpenAI GPT-4 (for NLP-driven question generation and response analysis)
  - OpenAI Whisper (for speech-to-text conversion)
  - IBM Watson (for emotion detection and analytics)
- **Deployment**: The platform will be hosted on a cloud infrastructure for optimal performance and accessibility.

## Development Progress
The project is currently under development and progressing through a structured five-phase lifecycle:
1. **Planning** - Completed
2. **Design** - Completed
3. **Development** - Ongoing
4. **Testing & Optimization** - Upcoming
5. **Deployment & Public Launch** - Future Phase

## Contribution & Feedback
Currently, contributions are not open as the core functionalities are being developed. However, constructive feedback and feature suggestions are encouraged to refine the platform further. 

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements
- **AI-Driven Vision Proctoring**: Implementing facial recognition and gaze-tracking for enhanced fraud detection.
- **Expanded AI Capabilities**: Integration of additional AI models for deeper insights into candidate behavior.
- **Multilingual Interview Support**: Supporting multiple languages to expand accessibility globally.
- **Advanced Data Analytics & Reporting**: Detailed reports with insights into hiring trends, candidate performance, and interview efficiency.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Responsive design for mobile and tablet accessibility.
- **Integration with HR Systems**: Enabling seamless data synchronization with existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
